          The idea was a prototype implementation of new home automation system using Wi-Fi technology. This System supports a wide range of home automation devices like power, management components and security components. The project presents a low-cost home control and monitoring system. An embedded microprocessor & microcontroller, with IP connectivity were used for accessing and controlling appliances using Smart phone app. This system doesnâ€™t require a server (in future updates, we can implement the use of cloud storage and analyse the data to generate graphs and theoretical monthly energy bill and work upon the total energy consumption to reduce the monthly energy bills). In general, we propose the prototype implementation of home automation system that uses Wi-Fi technology and Android OS. Users can control electrical appliances from home or office via smart phone. Application will also provide secure notifications and alarm for, LPG leakage, fire hazards and Burglary and many more as decided by user. We will be trying to our utmost level to make the prototype more user friendly, so that we can reach our products to most remote corner of the country and no service engineers to be called for installation and modification.

      <h3 class="w3-text-light-grey">Smart Security Using IoT</h2>
        <h4>Minor Project</h4>
        <p align="w3-justify">
          Building IoT has progressed essentially in the last couple of years since it has created a new era in the world of information and communication technologies. Security is becoming an important issue nowadays as the possibilities of intrusion are increasing day by day. Safety from intrusion, theft, fire, and leakage of flammable gas are the most important requirements of a home security system for the people. Our working of the project is completely remote-based, the user will have a keyless password-protected door lock so that the user wonâ€™t have to carry a key with him/her every time he/she leaves the house. To enter, the user must enter the passkey correctly which should match the predefined password. If the password is correct, the door will unlock, or else it will remain closed. The information that the door is locked or unlocked shall be available on the web via the esp32 module as it will send the data through Wi-Fi over the internet to the think speak platform. This data (whether the door is open or not) can be accessed by the user form any part of the world. On top of it every time the user unlocks the door, he/she will be sent a notification which will be an optional feature. Now coming to the other parts of this security system, whenever the user closes the door, the main electrical power supply will be shut down as the MCB in the house will be turned off via a servo motor. This will prevent wastage of electricity as well as it will prevent any case any short circuit or fault. In addition to electricity, the water valve and the gas valve will also turn off preventing water leakage and gas leakage. The Proximity sensor comes into effect whenever the user closes the door from inside, then the proximity sensor detects the presence of a person inside the room and doesnâ€™t allow the system to turn off the electricity and other systems. So, this proximity sensor ensures that all this protective equipment will come into action only if the user locks the door from inside and no one is present inside. We also have a gas sensor (MQ2) which will be present near the gas source (LPG cylinder) and it will continuously monitor whether there is any leakage or not. In case of any gas leakage, it will sound an alarm and turn off the gas valve thereby cutting off any further gas supply.

        <p align="w3-justify">
          In this project, we are trying to minimise the human effort required for irrigation, but not at the cost of decrease in Total Annual Productivity. We are trying to automate the irrigation process through which currently Advanced Farmer can look after his farm without even physically present at his field. This system has been programmed with the help of microcontroller in a way such that when the system goes ON, it gives the output information to the controller, and the information can be store in a database and it can be send to the owner with the help of internet. The useful information can be access by the owner for making decision related to his field no matter in which part of world he would be in. Almost every electronic component can be programmed and work independent of the human intervention. By putting our knowledge in controller we gave it ability to take decision on our behalf. One of the important thing that should be kept in mind during working with such controller is that they are hypersensitive because they work on 5 volt and our household supply is 240 volts. Large voltage can burn the controller shut down the system. So an efficient interfacing required between controller and the water motor. This system makes crop production much easier and this project uses a microcontroller, which commands the water pump and there are also soil-moisture sensors, which sense the moisture in the field. A rain sensor is been employed to spot rain and make the decision accordingly. If the farmer is at distant from his agricultural field he will be having a notion of current conditions. Thus, it saves farmerâ€™s effort, water, time and his Agriculture.

This project consists of counter of people in movement using computer vision. About this counting, our system can count how many people getting in and out from the monitored zone.

        <p align="w3-justify">
           In many electronic circuit applications, a delay of a few seconds or minutes becomes a crucial requirement for ensuring correct operation of the circuit. Without the specified delay the circuit could malfunction or even get damaged. As the name propose, 555 timers is essentially a "Timer", which makes an oscillating pulse. It implies for quite a while pin 3 is HIGH and for quite a while it stays LOW, which will make an oscillating output. We can utilize this property of 555 clocks to make different clock circuits like 1 min clock circuit, 5 min clock circuit, 10 min clock circuit, 15 min clock circuit, and so forth. All we have to change the value of Resistor R1 as well as Capacitor C1. We have to set 555 clocks in Monostable mode to fabricate Timer. In monostable mode, the length for which the PIN 3 would stay HIGH, is given by the beneath formulae: T = 1.1 * R1*C1

           Utilizing a typical rotating 10k potentiometer isn't the most intelligent thing one might want to introduce in a smart home. Since a rotating potentiometer is required to be used by the help of a user, by physically touching the devices, which in some cases might be dangerous, to dim the lights, we would require something which would be done by cell phones, smartly. Along these lines, here comes the AC DIMMER CIRCUIT USING MICROCONTROLLER, which can be controlled from anyplace, anytime. We noted the zero-cross with the full-bridge rectifier and the optocoupler. At that point we made a firing pulse applied the Opto-insulated DIAC through this resistor and an LED. We used Opto-insulated because this photocoupler has a light control of the diode inside so we separate the 5V from the Arduino and the 220V applied to the TRIAC. We read the zero-cross with the full-bridge rectifier and the optocoupler. At that point we make a firing pulse applied the Opto-insulated DIAC through this resistor and an LED.

        <p align="w3-justify">
           The opening and closing of doors is detected using the Hall Effect sensor. A Hall effect sensor is a device that is used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. Its output voltage is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength through it. Hall effect sensors are used for proximity sensing, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications. Bringing a strong magnet or magnetic field towards the sensor would lead to the output pin to toggle, efficiently triggering the ON and OFF state of the lights. The output pins of the microcontroller is being latched here. This particular latch will remember a digital High reading at the output of the sensor until an opposing magnetic field is sensed, at which point it will drop to digital Low and stay there until it is triggered again.

This approach emerged in the field of artificial swarm intelligence as well as the biological study of insects, ants and other fields in the nature, where a swarm behaviour occurs. Swarm Robotics is an emerging area in collective robotics which uses a fully distributed control paradigm and relatively simple robots to achieve coordinated behaviour at the group level. In Swarm Robotics, we through manual or autonomous way, control the working of the principal bot. The principal bot in turn controls all the remaining slave bots connected to it either through wireless medium. All the processes and paths followed by the master bot is invariantly passed on to the slave bot(s), which all are bound to follow the leader.

Whenever an object passes through PIR1 and then through PIR2, it means the person is added to previous person count of the room and the reverse. If happens, ie firstly it passes through PIR2 and then through PIR1, that means the object should be subtracted from the number of people previously residing in the room. When a person enters the room, count would be increased, whereas on leaving, the count would decrease.

        <p align="w3-justify">
          The Raspberry Pi is able to create audio using a pair of GPIO pins. The problem is that the audio is badly distorted. The low notes are too low and cause the speaker to rumble and sound blown, and the high notes have lots of unwanted noise. To assist with removing these noises,  this audio filter circuit was added to the original Raspberry Pi. An audio filter serves to remove unwanted frequencies. A low-pass filter removes high frequencies, and a high-pass filter removes low frequencies. The names say it all. The audio coming from the PWM is still very weak, and itâ€™s made weaker by passing it through the filter. This is plenty if only need to power headphones, but it really isnâ€™t enough to power speakers. We need an amplifier if we plan to do that.

Then the application will surely not be having all the remotely controlled devices, like it might not be having a feature for controlling an RC car, but, my application does that too! Moreover, you can add any number of remotes to this website, through the connected hardware, which will for the time being be available only for your own device, but at a later stage, after successful tests by the company, we might do an open market release for the same button which you have installed, certainly giving the credits to the owner.

  <div class="IR-receiver" data-aos="fade-left">
      <h3 class="w3-text-light-grey">Universal IR receiver using deep sleep power-saving mode</h2>
        <p align="w3-justify">
          This IoT device is a part of the previous protype, Universal IR blaster using IoT, Frontend and Backend development. This device is the receiver part of the same module, which is described before. The receiver receives the signal from any device having an IR blaster and sends it to the connected device, after decoding. The power saving mode is the main aim of this prototype. It happens that we are not needed to use the remote controller frequently, we changed to a particular receiving station, incase of a TV or set to particular temperature for AC and kept the remote away. Now, when we are not required any work of the IR receiver, it will still continue to receive signals (in this case garbage values, which can't be decoded), and that would be useless. Instead, we can just set the receiver to sleep until and unless it is required again. Here deep sleep comes to play.
